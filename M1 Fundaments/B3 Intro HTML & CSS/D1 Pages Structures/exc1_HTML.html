        Children of the sun, see your time has just begun, searching for your ways, through adventures every day. <br>
        Every day and night, with the condor in flight, with all your friends in tow, you search for the Cities of Gold. <br>
        Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah… wishing for The Cities of Gold. <br>
        Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah… some day we will find The Cities of Gold. <br>
        Do-do-do-do ah-ah-ah, do-do-do-do, Cities of Gold. <br>
        Do-do-do-do, Cities of Gold. <br>
        Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah… some day we will find The Cities of Gold. </p>

        There’s a voice that keeps on calling me. <br>
        Down the road, that’s where I’ll always be. <br>
        Every stop I make, I make a new friend. <br>
        Can’t stay for long, just turn around and I’m gone again. <br>
        Maybe tomorrow, I’ll want to settle down, Until tomorrow, I’ll just keep moving on.

        One for all and all for one, it’s a pretty story. <br>
        Sharing everything with fun, that’s the way to be. <br>
        One for all and all for one, Muskehounds are always ready. <br>
        One for all and all for one, helping everybody. <br>
        One for all and all for one, can sound pretty corny. <br>

        80 days around the world, we’ll find a pot of gold just sitting where the rainbow’s ending. <br>
        Time — we’ll fight against the time, and we’ll fly on the white wings of the wind. <br>
        80 days around the world, no we won’t say a word before the ship is really back. <br>
        Round, round, all around the world. Round, all around the world. <br>
        Round, all around the world. Round, all around the world.
